# Horse Racing Betting Strategy

Analysing ficticious placed horse racing bets to optimise a profit maximising strategy. A report is available as a word document in the files.

The function `create_and_tune_all_models()` in `project/models/classification_modelling.py` can be run any time the `bet_table.csv` is updated with more samples, and new metrics will be saved for the logistic regression, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
